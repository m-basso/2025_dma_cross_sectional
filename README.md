# 2025\_dma\_cross\_sectional



This repository contains all code generated during the analysis of dietary, psychological, and metagenomics data from a cohort of young women aged 18–24 years (N = 46).



Repository Structure:



All R notebooks are named according to their primary analytical purpose.



Each code chunk includes comments explaining what is being performed and why, to ensure transparency and reproducibility.



Contents



Cleaning and preprocessing scripts for dietary data, psychological outcomes, and metagenomic inputs



Exploratory data analysis notebooks for nutrients, food groups, microbial taxa, and metadata



Statistical analysis notebooks including MFA, robust regression models, and clustering



Utility functions for repeated operations



The project uses renv for reproducible R environments.



All package versions, dependencies, and R version information are recorded in the included renv.lock file.



To reproduce the environment, run --> renv::restore()



Purpose



This repository supports the cross-sectional analysis component of the DMA project conducted during my PhD and serves as a transparent record of code used in the manuscript.
